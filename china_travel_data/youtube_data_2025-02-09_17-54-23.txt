Year the year of the snake so we're going to explore we're going to get in and amongst the festivities see what this country is about and see what Mischief we can get up to so you notice everywhere people are holding up these things these decorations I'm not entirely sure what they are but they obviously have something to do with the the new lunar year so people like selling these everywhere and they're bringing them into places like this so I think this might be a temple in here how do we get in I've been in the country for less than 12 hours and one thing that I've already noticed is that the Chinese people are very respectful a lot of like civil order here it's nice things actually work the streets are clean the people are kind and you know compared to other countries especially countries with such a large population just works it's nice so all the people here are selling like the offerings you can get the incense like oil these are things that I saw on the other side people are holding these up I'm not exactly sure what they are hello hello hello what is this what is it English English okay all right let's go let's speak to this guy what is this what is it oh what is this is this a translator let's see what this is this is the trans shipment windmill this is trans shipment windmill the whole family is safe and good every year and everything is going on step by step this transfer windmill is what you bring home ah what about in here burn incense and wor okay okay how much see how much this 3 this 38 and that 28 okay I traveled the world for 6 years guys and I've never come across real translator so here in China everything is an online payment so luckily I have my revolute card that is is able to make all these payments whil I'm traveling the world so this is incense yeah oh wow okay okay thank you very much thank you basically these things guys when the wind comes it blows all the windmills meow how are you are you good people are super friendly here what is your name thank you thank you what is your name uh I hope you have a good time thank you thank you hey people are nice here guys it's super busy in the temple here but I found an area in the corner to quickly talk about today's sponsor revolute you know guys one of the most useful things when traveling to different countries is having revolute if you didn't know revolute is a financial app that lets you manage all aspects of your money in one place and comes with a range of everyday spending features and travel benefits revolute also comes with a debit card which is super handy especially here in China a place where they don't really use much cash and communicating with locals can be extremely difficult all you need to do is add your card to your phone and when you make a purchase your money will be automatically converted into the currency you need making it so easy to spend overseas without the hassle plus their exchange fees are much lower than some of the bigger Banks which makes a big difference when you're traveling but you know when you travel you can't rely on technology all the time sometimes you still need cash that's why with revolute you can get your own car delivered to your home which you can use to withdraw cash from anywhere in the world and revolute won't charge any withdrawal fee now I know a lot of you are anxious about using your card and worried about getting stolen and I totally understand as a full-time traveler I've been in so many sketchy situations where my only option was to pay with a card and I wouldn't have felt great about it either if it wasn't for revolute thanks to their single use cards I can generate a virtual card that is valid for just one transaction all right guys I'm at the temple and I want to show you how quick it is to create a onetime use card here at revolute so I'm on the app I click disposable get card for free and then just like that we have a single-use card to be used so that no one could steal our details so even if my details were stolen they'd be completely useless to them after that one transaction if you're interested guys you can download revolute using the link in the description or scan in the QR code on the screen and you get $40 after your first purchase hello helloow meow so here we are guys celebrating the Chinese New Year the year of the snake we're in the temple the wind is propelling my little propellers guys and hers basically people are lighting these incense they're coming into the front of this area and they're taking a moment to pray lots of people here doing this in their own different way this is cool look where we are right now guys in the middle of China with my little windmills this is sick so this is where you can burn your incense guys all right we have our hands kind of free guys let's see if we can fit some of these in I think we just got way too many come on oh thank you all right let's see well they take their time eh there

supposedly the fireworks set off and we'll be able to celebrate the new year I think everyone else has a similar idea we're down near like the Waterfront Bay Area there's cars that is not moving and everyone's walking as well I'm honestly surprised at the amount of international brands that are here in China 7-Eleven we've seen an abundance of Starbucks McDonald's KFC Domino's Hungary Jack even not hungry Jack Burger King Hungary Jack is the Australian version of Burger King but I finally reached the meeting point of everybody in China wow so what's going to happen I can't believe actually

going which is the firework place in 10 minutes supposedly the fireworks set off and we'll be able to celebrate the new year I think everyone else has a similar idea we're down near like the Waterfront Bay Area there's cars that is not moving and everyone's walking as well I'm honestly surprised at the amount of international brands that are here in China 7-Eleven we've seen an abundance of Starbucks McDonald's KFC Domino's Hungary Jack even not hungry Jack Burger King Hungary Jack is the Australian version of Burger King but I finally reached the meeting point of everybody in China wow so what's going to happen I can't believe actually made it in time literally 5 minutes till 8:00 and I think that's when the fireworks happen are you excited to see the fireworks hello [Music] say
