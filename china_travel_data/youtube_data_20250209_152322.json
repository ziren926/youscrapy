    "description": "My British mum just had her first-ever visit to China, and WOW, what an eye-opener! As a British mum, she grew up hearing so many negative stories about China from the Western media, but nothing could have prepared her for the REAL experience of being here.\n\nFrom the incredible hospitality of the locals to the rich culture and mind-blowing food, everything she’s seen firsthand completely contradicts what she was led to believe. The media paints such a one-sided, often misleading picture of China, and she can’t help but wonder why?\n\nIn this vlog, my mum shares her honest thoughts on what surprised her the most, the differences between perception and reality, and why she believes more people should visit China and see it for themselves. This country has so much to offer, and it’s time to challenge the misconceptions!\n\n#china #chinatravel #chinafood \n___________________________________________________ \n\n❤️  Become a Channel MEMBER to support us by clicking the link below ❤️\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZZwilU9bYdS-phW3M7lv6g/join\n\n*You can support us directly*\n👉 Donate a coffee (or two, or twelve) at: \nhttps://www.buymeacoffee.com/tazandlibby\n\n👉 Or, if you're feeling all PayPal-ish, here's our virtual tip jar: \nhttps://paypal.me/tazandlibby\n\nRemember, you fine folks are the genuine heroes in this blockbuster tale of caffeine and kindness!

It's bustling, hilly, and full of surprises. We wander through the wholesale markets, find hidden temples, and of course, eat some spicy Xiaomian noodles and Chongqing-style dumplings that might just be our new favorite meal. \n\nHave you been to Chongqing?

    "description": "Shé nián dàjí! 🐍✨ 有中文🇨🇳字幕！点击齿轮⚙️图标。\n\n*Help us reach 100k subscribers* www.youtube.com/@mikeandashley?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWe spent Chinese New Year in Guangzhou, and wow—this was an experience we’ll never forget. We had heard mixed things about visiting China during Spring Festival as tourists, so we did what we do best—hit the streets to see for ourselves!\n\nThe breathtaking flower markets and the mesmerizing lantern displays lighting up Yuexiu Park made the city feel like a dream. We even tried some unexpected festival snacks (some delicious, some… questionable 😂). As the night went on, we attempted to find the perfect fireworks spot on Shamian Island—spoiler alert: we had no idea we needed reservations. But in true Mike and Ashley fashion, we made the most of it, soaking in the energy, celebrating with locals, and finally catching the sky light up in the most unexpected way.\n\nThis was more than just a celebration—it was a reminder of what Chinese New Year is all about: family, tradition, and embracing the moment. We’re so grateful to have experienced this festival firsthand, and we wouldn’t have had it any other way.\n\nWould you visit China during Spring Festival?

If you love to eat, this city in China is a food paradise, from bustling outdoor markets, to the Muslim quarter, and never ending chili oil, we’re about to taste some of the best Chinese food that Xi’an has to offer. \n\nXiaonanmen Morning Market (小南门市场) - We’re staring in the morning along the Wall of Xi’an at Xiaonanmen Morning Market. Here you’ll find a plethora of street food and colorful ingredients. We tried the spicy tofu bean curd - 3 RMB ($0.43), the very popular Xi'an pork burger (肘子夹馍) - 10 RMB ($1.43), sticky rice dessert (Zeng Gao (甑糕) - 6 RMB ($0.86), and finally fried vegetable pocket (菜合).\n\nLuzhi Liangfen (老何家卤汁凉粉) - Next up we’re continuing this Chinese street food tour in the Muslim Quarter of Xi’an and trying a very unique dish of bean jelly noodles - Price - 17 RMB ($2.42).\n\nLao Jiajia Pepper Soup (老贾家胡辣汤) - Although it doesn’t look like much, hulatang (胡辣汤) - hot pepper soup, is extremely flavorful and this is one of the best bowls in Xi’an. \n\nLiuxinniu Mutton Soup (刘信牛羊肉泡馍) - You can’t visit Xi’an without trying Yangrou Paomo (羊肉泡馍) - a lamb and flatbread soup that’s cooked over a rocket jet flame.

Price - 28 RMB ($3.99)\n\nMa'er Youzhi Suantang Dumplings (马二优质酸汤水饺) - Next door you'll find a dumpling jacuzzi where you can enjoy some of the best sour soup dumplings you’ll ever have in your life.

This was one of the best bowls of noodles I’ve had in a long time. Price - 22 RMB ($3.14) \n\nZhubashi Wangjiao BBQ (竹笆市旺角烤肉) - Finally, another famous food in Xi’an, China is cumin lamb bbq, and as they grill it, they sprinkle it with cumin and chili pepper - it’s some of the best lamb ever. Price - 129 RMB ($18.39) for everything\n\nXi’an is a Chinese street food paradise, you’ll never run out of amazing food to try! \n\nChapters: \n0:00 Intro \n0:10 Xi’an bike ride\n2:02 Market \n6:43 Chinese Burger \n9:32 Sticky Rice \n11:11 Fried Chive Pocket \n13:29 Bean Jelly Noodles \n21:02 Muslim Quarter, Xi’an \n22:15 Hulatang - Hot Pepper Soup \n26:32 Yangrou Paomo \n38:23 Chinese Dumplings \n42:02 Great Mosque of Xi'an \n43:21 Hand Pulled Noodles \n51:00 Cumin Lamb BBQ\n\nThanks to Michael (chinglingtao@163.com)  \n\nFollow on Social Media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/markwiensfoodvideos \n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/migrationology/ \n►Tiktok: https://www.tiktok.com/@markwiens \n\n👕 T-shirts: https://store.migrationology.com/ \n🌶 Ghost Chili: https://amzn.to/3PNTvNQ\n🎥 Camera gear I use: https://amzn.to/3FVdBUd \n(some of these are affiliate links and I will make a small commission from any sales)",

Click the link below and use the coupon code 'DREW' for free shipping: https://bit.ly/DrewBinsky_MH\n\nI made it to Chongqing, China!! With a population of 36 million (yes, you read that right – 36 million!), Chongqing is a municipality that feels more like its own country. This city is massive and chaotic with futuristic skyscrapers and bustling street markets. It’s one of the most affordable big cities in the world and there’s something here for everyone to explore.\n\nIn this old-school travel vlog, I’ll take you on an adventure through the heart of Chongqing to meet the locals, try some of the spiciest food (hot pot, anyone?), and uncover the wacky culture that makes Chongqing such a unique destination.\n\nWhat really stood out to me about Chongqing is how it has all the energy and conveniences of a place like Hong Kong, but with almost ZERO tourists. The culture shock here is real, the people are incredibly kind, and the vibe is unlike any other city I’ve experienced in my travels to all 197 countries.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video, and please comment below with your thoughts! :)\n\n#china #asia #travel \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nThank you to ElevenLabs for dubbing my videos into Spanish, French, Portuguese, German and Arabic!
